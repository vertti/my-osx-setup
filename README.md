# my-osx-setup

Dot files, brew install scripts etc to setup OSX quickly the way I want it. Tested on Yosemite.

Contains the following scripts:

* `brew.sh` will install Homebrew and then use Homebrew to install bunch of useful software (git, coreutils, maven, node, etc.).
It will also install `Caskroom` and use that to install things like Chrome, VLC, Spotify etc.
* `cleanup_dock.sh` adds Chrome next to Launchpad in your dock and then remove many of the defaults in the dock like Photos, Safari, Email etc.
* `osx_tweaks.sh` runs bunch of commandline tweaks to how OSX works. I've picked stuff that suits my style from bunch of longer dotfiles repositories here in GitHub.
